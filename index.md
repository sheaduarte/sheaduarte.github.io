## About Me

I am currently a PhD student in psychology at UC Davis and the Center for Mind & Brain, where I work under Dr. Joy Geng in the Integrated Attention Lab. My research interests lie in **multisensory integration, attention, and how these related processes interact**. I'm most excited about taking advantage of new technologies, like **virtual reality (VR)** to study behavior in increasingly naturalistic, yet controlled settings. 

Before graduate school, I completed my B.A. in Psychology at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, where I worked in several research labs and participated in the **McNair Scholars Program**. In my free time, you can find me cooking or baking, in the ceramics studio, or in the cheese section of any grocery store.
